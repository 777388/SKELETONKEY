# SKELETONKEY
Proof of Concept for SKELETONKEY code breaker, implements a simultaneous stream of every possible binary position encoded as a character

Yields a constant stream of every possible binary position simultaneously. More tests will be done soon

FUTURE GOALS WITH THIS PROJECT
implement a character mapping that uses the code in a single character, so that you can implement this as such Username:~~~~~~~~ Password:~~~~~~~~
where ~ is the program. 


UPDATED for 8 chars at a time, it spits out some weird stuff that may imply looking at every binary position simultaneously may cause some sort of beginning of consciousness. while you would think it would be totally random, its apt to return responses such as MAMA, NANA, hahahahahaha, hehehehe, Poopoo, Peepee and lastly Zozo.
